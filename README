==============================================================================
WARNING: r500tool accesses hardware and memory directly and triggers SMM
interrupts.  It is not very clever at it; the address of the HDA audio
controller, for instance, is retrieved by parsing lspci output.  It is not
very well tested and may well activate the self-destruct mechanism on your
computer.  Also, the general idea of poking around in a hardware device from
userspace that is already controlled by a kernel driver is fishy to begin
with.  USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!

SECURITY HOLE: The DirectIO driver allows any process access to the physical
system memory and I/O ports. When it is loaded, all security bets are off!

This tool is designed for people running Mac OS X on a Toshiba Portege R500.
It is able to control the display brightness, turn the backlight off for
transflective mode, and watch the headphone jack to switch between internal
speakers and headphones automatically.

It requires the DirectIO driver from http://code.coreboot.org/p/directio/
To be able to query the headphone jack state, you also need to have lspci
installed.

r500tool includes code from DirectIO and switchaudio-osx
(http://code.google.com/p/switchaudio-osx/)

It can be run as a daemon in the background, watching the Fn-F6 and Fn-F7
hotkeys and the headphone jack and performing the desired actions.
