==============================================================================
WARNING: r500tool accesses hardware and memory directly and does SMBIOS
calls. It is not very clever at it; the address of the HDA audio controller,
for instance, is hardcoded to the value it has on my Portege R500. It may
well activate the self-destruct mechanism on yours. Also, the general idea
of poking around in a hardware device from userspace that is already
controlled by a kernel driver is fishy to begin with. USE WITH EXTREME
CAUTION!!

SECURITY HOLE: The DirectIO driver allows any process access to the physical
system memory and I/O ports. When it is loaded, all security bets are off!
==============================================================================

This tool is designed for people running Mac OS X on a Toshiba Portege R500.
It is able to control the display brightness, turn the backlight off for
transflective mode, and watch the headphone jack to switch between internal
speakers and headphones automatically.

It requires the DirectIO driver from http://code.coreboot.org/p/directio/

r500tool includes code from DirectIO and switchaudio-osx
(http://code.google.com/p/switchaudio-osx/)

It can be run as a daemon in the background, watching the Fn-F6 and Fn-F7
hotkeys and the headphone jack and performing the desired actions.
